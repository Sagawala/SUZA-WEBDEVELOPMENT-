# Web Development

Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites. It encompasses many different aspects, including web design, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting, and web server configuration. Web development is also known as website design, web programming, or web engineering.

Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications (web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services.

A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of World Wide Web applications, or applications that are run over HTTP from a web server to a web browser.

Web development is the coding or programming that enables website functionality, per the owner's requirements. It mainly deals with the non-design aspect of building websites, which includes coding and writing markup. Web development ranges from creating plain text pages to complex web-based applications, social network applications and electronic business applications.

The web development hierarchy is as follows:

Client-side coding: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Server-side coding: PHP, ASP.NET, Python, Ruby
Database technology: MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server

Web development can be divided into three parts: client-side coding, server-side coding, and database technology. Client-side coding covers the features that are seen and experienced by the user in the browser, such as the layout, design, and interactivity. Server-side coding covers the behind-the-scenes functionality, such as security, data processing, and email. Database technology is used to store and retrieve data from the database.aa
